# Group Theory

Library for syncing objects as part of a group. Requires some coding to actually be useful.

Usage:
1. Add the "GroupItem" script to objects that will become members of groups.
2. Inherit from the "Group" script to define what you want to happen when a group is joined.
3. Add your custom group scripts *somewhere* in your map. I recommend using empty gameobjects and keeping to one script per object.
4. Use the "Add" and "Remove" functions to add and remove objects to groups.
